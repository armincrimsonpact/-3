## Critical Issues Fixed

1. **Authentication**: Removed fake authentication, needs real implementation
2. **XSS Vulnerability**: Removed dangerouslySetInnerHTML
3. **Data Storage**: Implemented secure session storage instead of localStorage
4. **Build Config**: Enabled TypeScript and ESLint checks
5. **Security Headers**: Added comprehensive security headers
6. **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting implemented
7. **Error Handling**: Added error boundary component
8. **Dependencies**: Fixed versions instead of "latest"

## Remaining Tasks
